Instructions for program

Commands:
 	$ make 
		this command compiles all packet.java, send.java and receiver.java 
		by running javac on both java files.

	$ make clean
		remove all .class files which has been compiled
	$ java server
		run server program before run client. 
		server will generate a random port number for TCP negotiation with client.
		server has to be run before execute client program
	$ java client <host1/server_address> <n_port> msg
		run client program after server has been started.
		Any of the three arguments is missing will raise an exception.
		client will send a signal(1988) to server to initial negotiation

Instruction to run program:
	- place code files in same directory than makefile and input file.
	- execute make in order to compile the java files
	- run emulator first using this command ./nEmulator-linux386 9904 host2 9002 9920 host3 9995 1 0.2 0
        - then run the receiver by using: 
		java receiver host1 9920 9002 <output file >
	- at last, run the sender by using:
		java sender host1 9904 9995 <input text file>

Executable files:
	After make, you will get packet.class, sender.class and receiver.class that are both executable
	files
