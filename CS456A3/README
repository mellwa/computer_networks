Instructions for program

Commands:
 	$ make 
		this command compiles all packet.java, send.java and receiver.java 
		by running javac on both java files.

	$ make clean
		remove all .class files which has been compiled
	$ ./router <router id> <host of nse> <nse port> <router port>
		run the program to connect to nse.

Instruction to run program:
	- place code files in same directory than makefile and input file.
	- execute make in order to compile the java files and generate a script router
	- run nse first using this command ./nse-linux386 host2 12100
        - then run the receiver by using: 
		./router 1 host1 9999 9991

Executable files:
	After make, you will get router.class, Link.class, RIB.class, Topology.class are both executable
	files. But the script file router is the executable user should run
